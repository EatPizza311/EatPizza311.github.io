I’m a data engineer who believes crafting the perfect data solution is like making the ultimate pizza — precision, timing, and the right blend of ingredients are key. 

With over 4 years of experience in materials and telecom, I’ve been the chef behind machine learning solutions that range from discovering new materials (Bayesian Optimization is my secret sauce) to spotting production-line issues with YOLO before they can mess up the recipe.

My MLOps and data pipelines serve up insights with the consistency of a pizza delivery on a Friday night, ensuring stakeholders get exactly what they need. 

I’m driven by a passion for lifelong learning — always hungry to add new skills and ideas to my toolkit and find fresh approaches to any problem on the table.
